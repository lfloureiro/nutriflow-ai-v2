# Domain implementation status

This document tracks the implemented domain baseline so the code and domain documentation evolve together.

## Implemented foundation

### Family and Person

Implemented:

- Family aggregate root;
- Person linked to Family;
- locale and timezone support;
- API routes and services for Family and Person;
- persistence and tests.

### Person profile

Implemented:

- one-to-one PersonProfile;
- sex used for energy calculations;
- measurement system;
- energy unit;
- persistence and tests.

### Anthropometric history

Implemented:

- historical AnthropometricMeasurement records;
- metric, value, unit and measured timestamp;
- provenance fields for provider/device/external identifiers;
- ordered Person relationship;
- persistence and tests.

### Nutrition goals

Implemented:

- historical NutritionGoal records;
- goal type;
- optional target weight;
- optional target rate;
- start and target dates;
- status, source and notes;
- database validation for positive target values and valid date ordering;
- persistence and tests.

### Nutrition constraints

Implemented:

- NutritionConstraint records per Person;
- constraint and target types;
- target key and operator;
- minimum/maximum values and units;
- severity and mandatory/advisory distinction;
- provenance including professional source metadata;
- optional validity period;
- database validation for numeric ranges and date ordering;
- persistence and tests.

### Food preferences

Implemented:

- FoodPreference records per Person;
- subject type and normalized subject key;
- like/dislike preference type;
- preference intensity;
- provenance and optional validity dates;
- persistence and tests.

### Food adverse reactions

Implemented separately from preferences:

- FoodAdverseReaction records per Person;
- allergy/intolerance reaction type;
- subject type and normalized subject key;
- severity;
- mandatory safety flag;
- provenance including professional source metadata;
- optional validity dates;
- persistence and tests.

The separation between preferences and adverse reactions is intentional: preference ranking must never be confused with food safety restrictions.

## Current database migration chain

The implemented schema includes migrations through food preferences and adverse reactions, following the Family/Person, profile/anthropometric, nutrition goal and nutrition constraint migrations.

Alembic migrations are expected to be applied from an empty PostgreSQL database in CI and checked for model/schema drift.

## Next planned domain increments

Current sequence after the implemented foundation:

1. schedules and recurring/date-specific availability;
2. derived/versioned nutrition targets;
3. health-provider connections;
4. normalized health measurements with provenance and deduplication;
5. DailyHealthState and DailyNutritionState;
6. meal events, shared meals and individual servings;
7. adaptive planning and recommendation layers.

This list is directional. Each increment must be designed, documented, tested locally and validated in CI before integration into `main`.
